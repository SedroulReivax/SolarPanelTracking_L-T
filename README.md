Objective
The goal of this project is to design and implement a solar panel positioning system that automatically tracks the movement of the sun to maximize solar energy capture. The system adjusts the angle of the solar panel in real-time using a microcontroller, ensuring higher efficiency, better power output, and improved reliability of renewable energy generation.

Solution Model
The solution uses Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs) as sunlight sensors to detect the intensity of light. A microcontroller (e.g., Arduino/8051/PIC) processes the sensor data. Based on sensor readings, servo motors or stepper motors adjust the panel’s tilt (horizontal and/or vertical). This closed-loop feedback ensures the panel always faces the maximum light source.

Purpose
Solar panels work best when they face the sun directly, but fixed panels cannot follow the sun’s movement. This project aims to solve that problem by creating a solar tracking system using a microcontroller. The system adjusts the panel’s position in real time to capture more sunlight, making energy generation more efficient and reliable.


Architecture Of Arduino Uno
The Arduino UNO is built around the ATmega328P microcontroller, which is an 8-bit AVR RISC-based microcontroller. It follows a simple architecture with the following main blocks:

Microcontroller Core (ATmega328P):
•	8-bit processor running at 16 MHz clock speed.
•	32 KB Flash memory for program storage, 2 KB SRAM for data, and 1 KB EEPROM for permanent storage.


Power Supply Unit:
•	Can be powered through USB (5V) or an external adapter (7–12V).
•	Onboard voltage regulator provides stable 5V and 3.3V outputs.
Digital I/O Ports:
•	14 digital pins (0–13), out of which 6 can provide PWM output.
•	Used to connect sensors, actuators, and modules.

Analog Input Ports: 
•	6 analog pins (A0–A5) with a 10-bit ADC (Analog to Digital Converter).
•	Used to read sensor values like temperature, light, etc.

Timers and Counters:
•	Three timers (two 8-bit and one 16-bit) for PWM, delays, and event counting.

Communication Interfaces:
•	UART (Serial Communication)
•	SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)
•	I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)

Oscillator:
•	16 MHz quartz crystal provides the system clock.

USB Interface:
•	A USB-to-Serial converter (ATmega16U2) allows programming and serial communication with a PC.

Reset Circuit:
•	A reset button restarts the microcontroller program.


Result
The solar tracking system was successfully implemented and tested under different lighting conditions. The panel automatically adjusted its position to face the direction of maximum sunlight throughout the day. Compared to a fixed solar panel, the tracking system showed an increase in power output efficiency by around 25–30%. The results were validated by measuring the voltage and current output of the solar panel at different times (morning, noon, and evening), confirming that the system improves energy capture and overall performance.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the microcontroller-based solar tracking system provides a practical and cost-effective way to enhance solar energy utilization. By automatically aligning the panel with the sun’s movement, it ensures better energy capture compared to fixed systems. The project demonstrates how simple sensors and control logic can make renewable energy systems more efficient. With further improvements such as dual-axis tracking and weather-proofing, this system can be scaled for real-world applications and contribute to sustainable energy solutions.
